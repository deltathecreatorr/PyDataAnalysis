# PyDataAnalysis
This repository holds the files for a program that pulls data and analyses data from the materials project database.

## Pre-requisites

Before accessing this program, the user must have an account with the [Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) and have their api key ready. The api key can be found in the dashboard of the user's account.

You can also access the dashboard using this [link](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/dashboard)

If no API key is provided the application will be used in offline mode, where the user will only be able to access the cached data from pre-existing api queries.
